    /* 
        The code uses several useEffect hooks to handle different tasks, such as fetching sellers, creating new sessions, and handling socket events. This can make the code difficult to read and understand, since the different hooks are not clearly separated and can be triggered by different combinations of dependencies. A better approach would be to split the code into separate functions for each task, and use a single useEffect hook to call those functions. This would make the code more organized and easier to understand.
    
        The code uses several inline functions and callbacks, such as handleChange, handleClick, and addNewSession. This can make the code difficult to read, since the inline functions are not clearly separated and can be difficult to understand without reading the entire code. A better approach would be to define each function in a separate, named function, and use the named functions instead of the inline versions. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
    
        The code uses several flags and state variables, such as isLoading, isReady, nameError, and QR, to control the flow of the application. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain, since the different flags and state variables can be difficult to track and modify. A better approach would be to use a more structured approach to manage the state of the application, such as using a finite state machine or a reducer. This would make the code more predictable and easier to modify.
    
        The code uses several magic strings, such as "newSeller", "qrNew", and "okSeller", to identify events in the socket communication. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain, since the magic strings are not clearly associated with the events they represent. A better approach would be to define constants for the event names, and use the constants instead of the magic strings. This would make the code more readable and easier to modify.
    
        The code uses several inline ternary expressions to render different components based on the state of the application. This can make the code difficult to read and understand, since the different conditions and their corresponding components are not clearly separated. A better approach would be to use a more structured approach to rendering components based on the state, such as using a switch statement or a separate function for each state. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand.
    
        The code uses an empty string as the value for the first option in the datalist element. This is not a good user experience, since the user will see an empty option in the dropdown list when they focus the input field. A better approach would be to use a more descriptive value for the first option, such as "--- Sesiones guardadas ---", to indicate to the user what the options in the list represent.
    
        The code uses the key attribute on the option elements in the datalist element. This is not necessary, since the option elements are not rendered in a list and do not need a unique key. Removing the key attribute would make the code simpler and more efficient.
    
        The code uses several inline styles on the elements in the component. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain, since the styles are not clearly separated from the rest of the code. A better approach would be to define the styles in a separate stylesheet and use class names to apply the styles to the elements. This would make the code more readable and easier to modify.

export function MessagesColumn() {
    /* 
        The code uses the useEffect hook to handle the newMessage event from the socket, and to scroll to the bottom of the messages list when the messages change. This can make the code difficult to read and understand, since the different tasks performed by the useEffect hook are not clearly separated and can be difficult to follow. A better approach would be to split the code into separate functions for each task, and use separate useEffect hooks to call those functions. This would make the code more organized and easier to understand.
        
        The code uses a magic string, "newMessage", to identify the newMessage event from the socket. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain, since the magic string is not clearly associated with the event it represents. A better approach would be to define a constant for the event name, and use the constant instead of the magic string. This would make the code more readable and easier to modify.
        
        The code uses the scrollTo method to scroll to the bottom of the messages list. This is not the recommended way to scroll an element in React, since it can cause performance issues and is not compatible with the useRef hook. A better approach would be to use the scrollIntoView method, which is optimized for performance and works well with useRef.
        
        The code uses the map method to render the ItemMessage components for each message in the messages list. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain, since the mapping logic and the rendering logic are mixed together. A better approach would be to separate the mapping logic from the rendering logic, by using the map method to create an array of ItemMessage components, and then rendering the array using the Fragment component or the Array method. This would make the code more readable and easier to modify.

export function Login() {
    /* 
        handleSubmit
        
        The code uses a single if statement to check if the email or password fields in the form are empty, and return if either of them is empty. This can make the code difficult to read and maintain, since the different conditions are not clearly separated and the logic for each condition is not clearly defined. A better approach would be to use separate if statements for each condition, and define the logic for each condition separately. This would make the code more readable and easier to modify.
        
        The code uses the FormData class to retrieve the values of the email and password fields from the form. This is not necessary, since the event.currentTarget object already contains the values of the fields as properties. A better approach would be to use the event.currentTarget object directly to retrieve the values of the fields, without creating a new FormData object. This would make the code more efficient and easier to understand.
        
        The code uses the loggedUser object to store the values of the email and password fields. This is not necessary, since the authorizeUser function only needs the values of the fields as arguments, and does not need to store them in an object. A better approach would be to pass the values of the fields directly to the authorizeUser function, without creating the loggedUser object. This would make the code simpler and more efficient.
    
    
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
      event.preventDefault();
    
      // Get the values of the fields from the event object
      const email = event.currentTarget.email.value;
      const password = event.currentTarget.password.value;
    
      // Check if the email or password is empty
      if (!email) {
        // Handle the error for empty email
      } else if (!password) {
        // Handle the error for empty password
      } else {
        // Call the authorizeUser function with the values of the fields
        authorizeUser(email, password);
      }
    };

export function ClientsColumn() {
/* 
    The useEffect hook that is used to listen for newMessage events from the socket is executed every time the component is rendered, since it depends on the queryClient and clientData variables. This is not necessary, since the hook only needs to be executed once, when the component is initially rendered. A better approach would be to specify an empty array as the second argument for the useEffect hook, so that it is only executed once. This would make the code more efficient and avoid unnecessary re-renders of the component.

    The useState hook that is used to store the newMessageNum value is not initialized with a default value. This means that the newMessageNum variable will be undefined until a newMessage event is received from the socket, and this can cause errors in the code. A better approach would be to initialize the newMessageNum variable with a default value, such as an empty object or an empty string, to avoid this issue. This would make the code more robust and avoid potential errors.

    The if statement that is used to check if a message is from the user or from the client is redundant and can be simplified. The msg.fromMe property will always be false for messages from the client, so it is not necessary to check for this condition. A better approach would be to simply use the msg.fromMe property directly, without the if statement. This would make the code more concise and easier to understand.
